Project structure

source/: reusable R functions (data generation, model fitting, CI methods, scenario runner).

scripts/: entry script(s) that run one simulation scenario based on SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.

data/: intermediate results (.rds), one file per scenario (not tracked by git).

logs/: Slurm stdout/stderr logs (not tracked by git).

How to reproduce (cluster)

From the project root (the folder containing job_slurm_array.sh):

cd ~/code/bios731_hw2_xu


(Optional) smoke test a couple of scenarios:

sbatch --array=1-2 job_slurm_array.sh


Run all scenarios in parallel (18 total):

sbatch --array=1-18 job_slurm_array.sh


Confirm outputs (should be 18 .rds files):

ls data/*.rds | wc -l

How to reproduce (local, optional)

Run a single scenario by providing a scenario id:

SCENARIO_ID=1 NSIM=500 B=500 B_INNER=100 Rscript scripts/run_scenario_main.R

Notes

Each Slurm array task runs exactly one scenario and saves one .rds file to data/.

data/ and logs/ are excluded from version control via .gitignore.
