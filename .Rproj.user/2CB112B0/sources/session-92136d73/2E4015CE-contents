## Project structure

source/: reusable R functions (data generation, model fitting, CI methods, scenario runner).

scripts/: entry script(s) that run one simulation scenario based on SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.

data/: intermediate results (.rds), one file per scenario (not tracked by git).

logs/: Slurm stdout/stderr logs (not tracked by git).

### How to reproduce on cluster

1. From the project root:

```
cd ~/bios731_hw2_xu
```

2. Run all scenarios in parallel (18 total):

```
sbatch --array=1-18 job_slurm_array.sh
```

## Notes

data/ and logs/ are excluded from version control via .gitignore.
